Welcome to my frontend learning notes, an example of **open learning in the AI era**.

## Learning Principles

- Learn through projects, practice openly, and teach to reinforce understanding
- Keep things simple, stay up-to-date, and focus on human needs
- Collaborate effectively with AI
- Seek inspiration and cultivate aesthetic sensibility

## My Understanding

- Project-driven  
  Focus on building complete projects to learn by doing, rather than just following syntax or tutorials.

- Open learning and teaching each other  
  Actively participate in communities, discussions, and platforms‚Äîwrite blogs, create tutorials, and share your process publicly.

- Pursue simplicity  
  True mastery comes when complexity resolves into clarity‚Äîseeing the essence in what you build.

- Stay current  
  Continuously update your tech stack to keep pace with the evolving frontend landscape.

- Human-centered  
  Avoid letting code serve only business goals while neglecting people.  
  In personal learning and development, always ensure technology serves human needs.

- Seek inspiration  
  Follow mentors and peers who spark new ideas.  
  Inspiration is not about answering existing questions, but about enabling you to ask questions you hadn‚Äôt considered before.

- Cultivate aesthetics  
  In the AI era, productivity, narrow skills, or experience alone become less differentiating over time.  
  Developing aesthetic taste is increasingly key to standing out personally and professionally.
