## Learning Principles

- Project-driven, open learning, teaching is the best way to learn
- Pursue simplicity, keep up with the times, human-centered
- Collaborate fully with AI
- Gain inspiration and improve aesthetics

## My Understanding

- Project-driven  
  Start from complete projects and learn through practice, rather than focusing solely on syntax or tutorials.

- Open learning, teaching and learning from each other  
  Be active in related topics, communities, and websites‚Äîwrite blogs, create tutorials, and share your process.

- Pursue simplicity  
  Learning ultimately leads to the stage of "seeing the mountain as the mountain," returning to the essence.

- Keep up with the times  
  Keep your tech stack updated to stay aligned with frontend development trends.

- Human-centered  
  Too much code serves business purposes while ignoring human needs.  
  At least in personal learning and development, remember that technology should serve people.

- Gain inspiration  
  Seek and follow mentors who inspire you.  
  Inspiration is not about _answering existing questions_, but _helping people ask questions they hadn‚Äôt thought of before_.

- Improve aesthetics  
  In the AI era, the cost-effectiveness of productivity, single skills, or work experience decreases year by year.  
  Enhancing aesthetic taste is becoming a key factor in personal differentiation.
